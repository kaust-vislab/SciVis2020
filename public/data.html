    <h1>Data</h1>

    <p>The data set consists of an ensemble (50 members) of
    time-dependent 3D flow and scalar fields on a regular grid
    (500x500x50, 60 time steps) covering one month of
    simulation time. The size in uncompressed NetCDF format
    is 1.5 TB (64 GB compressed).</p>

    <h2>Download the data</h2>
    <p>
        Download the data from here:<br>

    <p>You can either download all ensmebles in a zipped archive (~64GB) by pressing the "Download" button on the upper right, or as individual files.
    Each ensemble member extracts to one netcdf file (~32GB), the whole data set extracts to approximately 1.4 TB.</p>
    <p>After you have downloaded some or all ensmeble members as .tgz files you can check against the provided md5 checksum to see if the download succeeded.</p>
    
    <h2>Loading the data in ParaView</h2>
    <p>As an example, we describe how to load the data in ParaView. ParaView can load the netcdf file, but will not assemble all the data correctly.
    This requires a few steps.</p>
